# Lingmo Desktop

Lingmo for the desktop form factor. This repository contains code for many of the widgets, KCMs, and other parts of the Lingmo Desktop.

See [the CODEMAP](./CODEMAP.md) to get an idea of the layout of this repository.

## See Also

This repository contains only components specific to the desktop form factor. Components which are more generic can be found elsewhere under the [Lingmo group](https://invent.kde.org/lingmo/) or in individual repositories. For example:

* [Lingmo Workspace](https://invent.kde.org/lingmo/lingmo-workspace) contains more generic code shared between Desktop, Mobile, and other form factors of Lingmo. If you can't find what you're looking for in lingmo-desktop, look here first.
* [liblingmo](https://invent.kde.org/lingmo/liblingmo) includes the building blocks for Lingmo widgets.
* [Lingmo NetworkManager Applet](https://invent.kde.org/lingmo/lingmo-nm) has code for the network manager widget.
* [Lingmo PulseAudio Applet](https://invent.kde.org/lingmo/lingmo-pa) is where the code for the PulseAudio KCM and widget lives.
* [Lingmo Add-ons](https://invent.kde.org/lingmo/kdelingmo-addons) is the home of the rest of the widgets that aren't in lingmo-desktop, lingmo-workspace, or another specific repository. For example: Web Browser, Comics, and Sticky Notes.

## Building

The easiest way to make changes and test Lingmo Desktop during development is to [build it with kdesrc-build](https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/building/).
